Steps to get the webserver running (limited success):

$ sudo apt-get install lighttpd php5 php5-cgi php5-sqlite php5-gd
$ sudo systemctl stop apache
$ sudo systemctl disable apache
$ sudo lighty-enable-mod fastcgi
$ sudo lightly-enable-mod fastcgi-php
$ sudo systemctl restart lighttpd

At this point, if you browse to localhost, you'll (hopefully) see the default lighttpd page.
You can put a .php file in your default webserver directory:

$ sudo vim /var/www/html/info.php

In this file, just write <?php phpinfo(); ?>

$ sudo chmod 644 info.php

Browse to localhost/info.php and you should get the phpinfo page.

If you want to be really cool, then do:

$ sudo lighty-enable-mod userdir
$ sudo systemctl restart lighttpd

In your home directory (~), you can make a public_html/ folder so you don't have to be in a root-owned directory.
Now you can do this:

$ vim ~/public_html/info.php

Do the same thing as above: <?php phpinfo(); ?>

Now browse to localhost/~<USERNAME> and you should get the same page.

This also works if you make a symbolic link to a different directory, so if you keep all your code from
class in one folder and you don't want to copy back and forth, just make a symbolic link to your folder
and call the link public_html. It doesn't know the difference and works just fine.
